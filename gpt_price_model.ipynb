Here's a detailed understanding of the considerations you outlined and how they shape the approach for the task:\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Key Considerations**\\n\\n#### **1. Limited Reasoning Capability of the LLM**\\n- **Challenge**: The LLM you're working with lacks advanced reasoning or reflection abilities seen in state-of-the-art models like GPT-4 or Claude. This requires us to craft a **systematic prompting strategy** that maximizes the model's potential through:\\n  - Carefully designed prompt templates.\\n  - Trigger phrases that invoke reasoning processes.\\n  - Explicit instructions to guide step-by-step thought processes.\\n- **Potential Approach**: \\n  - Use structured reasoning scaffolds (e.g., \\\"Reflect on the query: What might this refer to? What ambiguities exist?\\\").\\n  - Create explicit mappings and use examples to clarify intent.\\n  - Design fallback strategies to handle incomplete reasoning gracefully.\\n\\n#### **2. Importance of Reasoning Power**\\n- **User Query Flexibility**: Queries may be highly varied, ambiguous, or contain typos, requiring a robust framework for intent inference. For instance:\\n  - The query \\\"What is the full name of 1001?\\\" could refer to multiple fields, requiring context-sensitive resolution.\\n  - Queries like \\\"the full name of the top company in AI\\\" involve multi-table reasoning and demand external knowledge or additional contextual data.\\n- **Model's Role**:\\n  - Interpret and disambiguate intent based on table-field relationships.\\n  - Identify when the schema lacks sufficient data to fully answer a query and reflect this back clearly to the user.\\n  - Handle missing or ambiguous data gracefully, flagging potential sources of confusion.\\n\\n#### **3. Incomplete Table-Field Relationships**\\n- **Challenge**: The schema might not contain all the data required to resolve the query.

Here's a detailed understanding of the considerations you outlined and how they shape the approach for the task:\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Key Considerations**\\n\\n#### **1. Limited Reasoning Capability of the LLM**\\n- **Challenge**: The LLM you're working with lacks advanced reasoning or reflection abilities seen in state-of-the-art models like GPT-4 or Claude. This requires us to craft a **systematic prompting strategy** that maximizes the model's potential through:\\n  - Carefully designed prompt templates.\\n  - Trigger phrases that invoke reasoning processes.\\n  - Explicit instructions to guide step-by-step thought processes.\\n- **Potential Approach**: \\n  - Use structured reasoning scaffolds (e.g., \\\"Reflect on the query: What might this refer to? What ambiguities exist?\\\").\\n  - Create explicit mappings and use examples to clarify intent.\\n  - Design fallback strategies to handle incomplete reasoning gracefully.\\n\\n#### **2. Importance of Reasoning Power**\\n- **User Query Flexibility**: Queries may be highly varied, ambiguous, or contain typos, requiring a robust framework for intent inference. For instance:\\n  - The query \\\"What is the full name of 1001?\\\" could refer to multiple fields, requiring context-sensitive resolution.\\n  - Queries like \\\"the full name of the top company in AI\\\" involve multi-table reasoning and demand external knowledge or additional contextual data.\\n- **Model's Role**:\\n  - Interpret and disambiguate intent based on table-field relationships.\\n  - Identify when the schema lacks sufficient data to fully answer a query and reflect this back clearly to the user.\\n  - Handle missing or ambiguous data gracefully, flagging potential sources of confusion.\\n\\n#### **3.

Strengths of the Current Workflow**\\n1. **Modularity**:\\n   - The design separates concerns into distinct agents, making each task simpler and more focused.\\n   - Splitting the Field Reasoning Agent into two agents (Field Mapping and Gap Detection) reduces task ambiguity and aligns well with the principle of single responsibility.\\n\\n2. **Scalability**:\\n   - Modular agents can be replaced or improved independently. For example, if a better LLM becomes available, only specific agents might need retraining or updating.\\n\\n3. **Fallback Handling**:\\n   - The feedback loop between the Gap Detection Agent and the Table Finder Agent ensures robust handling of incomplete queries or insufficient data.\\n   - This mechanism improves the user experience by addressing ambiguous or unsupported queries dynamically.\\n\\n4. **Clarity of LLM Outputs**:\\n   - By dividing tasks, each agent generates a specific type of output, reducing complexity and ensuring more predictable results.\\n   - Clear outputs are easier to debug and interpret, particularly in real-world applications where stability is critical.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### **2. Potential Weaknesses**\\n1. **Workflow Complexity**:\\n   - Introducing multiple agents increases the overall complexity of the system:\\n     - Requires robust inter-agent communication.\\n     - Potential latency due to back-and-forth cycles between agents.\\n   - Increases the difficulty of implementing and maintaining the pipeline.\\n\\n2. **Rigid Sequence of Agents**:\\n   - The workflow assumes a fixed sequence: User Query → Table Finder → Field Mapping → Gap Detection. If queries vary greatly in complexity, this rigidity might introduce inefficiencies.\\n     - Example: A query might require minimal reasoning and SQL generation but still go through unnecessary steps.\\n\\n3. **Dependence on Table Finder Agent**:\\n   - The Table Finder Agent is a critical component. If it misidentifies the relevant tables, downstream agents will fail.\\n   - Ambiguous queries that straddle multiple tables might require more flexible handling than a single-table selection.\\n\\n4. **Error Propagation**:\\n   - Errors in one agent’s reasoning (e.g., Field Mapping Agent) might propagate to subsequent agents, compounding inaccuracies.\\n   - Example: If a field is incorrectly mapped, the Gap Detection Agent might misdiagnose schema sufficiency.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Suggestions for Improvement**\\n\\n#### **1. Enhance Workflow Flexibility**\\n- **Dynamic Routing**:\\n  - Instead of a rigid sequence, use a controller agent that dynamically decides which agents to invoke based on the complexity of the query.\\n  - For example:\\n    - Simple queries (\\\"Find the full name of Company 1001\\\") might skip the Gap Detection Agent and go directly to the SQL Generator.\\n    - Complex queries (\\\"What’s the full name of the top AI company?\\\") trigger all agents, including multiple feedback loops.\\n\\n#### **2. Optimize Inter-Agent Communication**\\n- **Standardized Data Passing**:\\n  - Use a shared data structure (e.g., JSON) to communicate between agents. This structure should include:\\n    - User query and processed intent.\\n    - Identified tables and fields.\\n    - Flags indicating schema sufficiency or gaps.\\n  - Example JSON structure:\\n    ```json\\n    {\\n      \\\"user_query\\\": \\\"What’s the full name of the top AI company?\\\",\\n      \\\"identified_tables\\\": [\\\"CompanyInfo\\\", \\\"Ranking\\\"],\\n      \\\"mapped_fields\\\": [\\\"CompanyName\\\"],\\n      \\\"schema_sufficient\\\": false,\\n      \\\"suggested_fallback\\\": \\\"Ranking table lookup\\\"\\n    }\\n    ```\\n\\n#### **3. Introduce Query Preprocessing**\\n- Add a lightweight **Preprocessing Agent** at the beginning of the workflow:\\n  - Correct typos, normalize user input, and extract key entities (e.g., numbers, keywords).\\n  - Preprocessing reduces ambiguity and improves the performance of downstream agents.\\n\\n#### **4. Reinforce Robustness Against Table Finder Errors**\\n- **Multi-Table Exploration**:\\n  - Allow the Table Finder Agent to output multiple potential tables with confidence scores.\\n  - Downstream agents can prioritize tables based on these scores or combine data across tables if necessary.\\n- **Fallback Tables**:\\n  - Maintain a set of common fallback tables (e.g., metadata or ranking tables) that the agents can query in case of insufficient schema information.\\n\\n#### **5. Evaluate Trade-offs of Complexity**\\n- Complexity can be mitigated by:\\n  - Grouping logically related agents (e.g., Field Mapping and Gap Detection could remain part of the same reasoning step if inter-agent communication proves costly).\\n  - Balancing modularity with workflow simplicity.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Updated Blueprint**\\n\\nHere’s a refined version of your blueprint with dynamic routing and preprocessing:\\n\\n```plaintext\\nUser Query -> |Preprocessing Agent| => Cleaned Query + Key Entities\\n\\nCleaned Query + Key Entities -> |Controller Agent|\\n    -> Dynamically Route:\\n        1. |Table Finder Agent| => Candidate Tables\\n        2. |Field Mapping Agent| => Mapped Fields\\n        3. |Gap Detection Agent| => Schema Sufficiency or Fallback Suggestions\\n\\nController Agent -> Finalized Tables + Fields -> |SQL Generator Agent| => SQL Query\\n```\\n\\n**Dynamic Routing Examples**:\\n1. **Simple Query**:\\n   - User Query: \\\"What’s the full name of Company 1001?\\\"\\n   - Workflow: Preprocessing → Table Finder → Field Mapping → SQL Generator.\\n\\n2. **Complex Query**:\\n   - User Query: \\\"What’s the full name of the top AI company?\\\"\\n   - Workflow: Preprocessing → Table Finder → Field Mapping → Gap Detection → Table Finder (Fallback) → SQL Generator.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Key Questions for Refinement**\\n1. **What is the expected variability in user queries?**:\\n   - Will users consistently provide enough context for table and field identification, or should we assume ambiguity is common?\\n2. **How frequent are multi-table queries?**:\\n   - If rare, simpler workflows might suffice; if frequent, the blueprint should prioritize flexible multi-table reasoning.\\n3. **How important is real-time performance?**:\\n   - If latency is a concern, a simpler, single-pass workflow might be better than multi-agent feedback loops.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis updated analysis and blueprint provide a more robust, flexible, and efficient workflow while addressing potential pitfalls.

Evaluate Trade-offs of Complexity**\\n- Complexity can be mitigated by:\\n  - Grouping logically related agents (e.g., Field Mapping and Gap Detection could remain part of the same reasoning step if inter-agent communication proves costly).\\n  - Balancing modularity with workflow simplicity.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Updated Blueprint**\\n\\nHere’s a refined version of your blueprint with dynamic routing and preprocessing:\\n\\n```plaintext\\nUser Query -> |Preprocessing Agent| => Cleaned Query + Key Entities\\n\\nCleaned Query + Key Entities -> |Controller Agent|\\n    -> Dynamically Route:\\n        1. |Table Finder Agent| => Candidate Tables\\n        2. |Field Mapping Agent| => Mapped Fields\\n        3. |Gap Detection Agent| => Schema Sufficiency or Fallback Suggestions\\n\\nController Agent -> Finalized Tables + Fields -> |SQL Generator Agent| => SQL Query\\n```\\n\\n**Dynamic Routing Examples**:\\n1. **Simple Query**:\\n   - User Query: \\\"What’s the full name of Company 1001?\\\"\\n   - Workflow: Preprocessing → Table Finder → Field Mapping → SQL Generator.\\n\\n2. **Complex Query**:\\n   - User Query: \\\"What’s the full name of the top AI company?\\\"\\n   - Workflow: Preprocessing → Table Finder → Field Mapping → Gap Detection → Table Finder (Fallback) → SQL Generator.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Key Questions for Refinement**\\n1. **What is the expected variability in user queries?**:\\n   - Will users consistently provide enough context for table and field identification, or should we assume ambiguity is common?\\n2. **How frequent are multi-table queries?**:\\n   - If rare, simpler workflows might suffice; if frequent, the blueprint should prioritize flexible multi-table reasoning.\\n3. **How important is real-time performance?**:\\n   - If latency is a concern, a simpler, single-pass workflow might be better than multi-agent feedback loops.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis updated analysis and blueprint provide a more robust, flexible, and efficient workflow while addressing potential pitfalls.

    "{\"name\":\"Assistant\",\"is_user\":False,\"is_name\":True,\"send_date\":1733768900.835544,\"mes\":\"Below is an updated analysis incorporating your new considerations, and proposing how to minimally adjust the current architecture to accommodate reflection mechanisms and incremental data fetching.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### New Considerations\\n\\n1. **Fixed Prompt Templates for Table Finder & Field Match**  \\n   - **Table Finder Agent**: Already has a stable prompt template.\\n   - **Field Mapping Agent**: Also has a defined prompt template, but it receives dynamically generated schema snippets from Python functions. This allows for tailoring the schema context to each run without overloading the prompt.\\n\\n   **Benefit**:  \\n   By constructing the field table snippet dynamically before calling the Field Mapping Agent, you can ensure each invocation only contains the most relevant subset of schema. This keeps costs low and performance stable.\\n\\n2. **Information Insufficiency & SQL Generator Invocation**  \\n   - If the Field Mapping Agent identifies insufficient schema information to fully answer the query, the logic now requires still invoking the SQL Generator Agent to fetch whatever partial information is known at that point.\\n   - After executing the generated SQL query and retrieving the results, we can supply that data back into the pipeline. This data might help clarify remaining ambiguities or identify which additional tables are needed.\\n   \\n   **Rationale**:  \\n   Even partial SQL queries can yield data that the Field Mapping Agent didn’t have. For example, retrieving a list of company codes might clarify which table is needed next or confirm which \\\"1001\\\" the user was referring to.\\n\\n3. **Reflection Mechanism**  \\n   - The system eventually needs a way to reflect on incorrect or incomplete reasoning. This reflection can occur after receiving SQL results.\\n   - Once the initial SQL query returns data, the system can:\\n     1. Check if the returned data makes sense.\\n     2. Identify if further refinement is needed.\\n     3.

This approach maintains your core architecture—Table Finder, Field Mapping, and SQL Generator Agents—while enabling iterative refinement and handling ambiguous queries more effectively. It’s a minimal but powerful enhancement that sets the stage for more sophisticated reflection and correction strategies in the future.\",\"swipes\":[\"Below is an updated analysis incorporating your new considerations, and proposing how to minimally adjust the current architecture to accommodate reflection mechanisms and incremental data fetching.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### New Considerations\\n\\n1. **Fixed Prompt Templates for Table Finder & Field Match**  \\n   - **Table Finder Agent**: Already has a stable prompt template.\\n   - **Field Mapping Agent**: Also has a defined prompt template, but it receives dynamically generated schema snippets from Python functions. This allows for tailoring the schema context to each run without overloading the prompt.\\n\\n   **Benefit**:  \\n   By constructing the field table snippet dynamically before calling the Field Mapping Agent, you can ensure each invocation only contains the most relevant subset of schema. This keeps costs low and performance stable.\\n\\n2. **Information Insufficiency & SQL Generator Invocation**  \\n   - If the Field Mapping Agent identifies insufficient schema information to fully answer the query, the logic now requires still invoking the SQL Generator Agent to fetch whatever partial information is known at that point.\\n   - After executing the generated SQL query and retrieving the results, we can supply that data back into the pipeline. This data might help clarify remaining ambiguities or identify which additional tables are needed.\\n   \\n   **Rationale**:  \\n   Even partial SQL queries can yield data that the Field Mapping Agent didn’t have. For example, retrieving a list of company codes might clarify which table is needed next or confirm which \\\"1001\\\" the user was referring to.\\n\\n3. **Reflection Mechanism**  \\n   - The system eventually needs a way to reflect on incorrect or incomplete reasoning. This reflection can occur after receiving SQL results.\\n   - Once the initial SQL query returns data, the system can:\\n     1. Check if the returned data makes sense.\\n     2. Identify if further refinement is needed.\\n     3. Potentially trigger another round of Field Mapping or Table Finding with the new data context.\\n\\n   **Minimal Change Goal**:  \\n   Introduce a reflection step that can be seamlessly integrated into the current architecture without overhauling it. The reflection step would be controlled by the central Controller/Orchestrator agent.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Revised Workflow with Minimal Adjustments\\n\\n**Key Addition**: A reflection loop that involves the Controller, triggered after SQL execution, before finalizing the answer to the user.\\n\\n**Step-by-Step**:\\n\\n1. **Preprocessing Agent** (Optional):  \\n   Normalize and extract key entities from the user query.\\n\\n2. **Controller/Orchestrator Agent**:\\n   - Receives the user query and initial schema snippet (if any).\\n   - Calls the **Field Mapping Agent** to attempt to map fields directly.\\n\\n3. **Field Mapping Agent** (First Pass):\\n   - Uses the current schema snippet (provided by the Controller) and attempts to identify needed fields.\\n   - If **all fields are mapped**: Proceed to SQL Generator.\\n   - If **some fields are missing or ambiguous**:\\n     - The Field Mapping Agent specifies what is missing.\\n     - The Controller invokes the **Table Finder Agent** to locate the missing schema information.\\n\\n4. **Table Finder Agent**:\\n   - Given the request from the Controller (e.g., \\\"Need a table for AI company rankings\\\"), returns a minimal schema snippet.\\n   - The Controller now has additional schema info.\\n\\n5. **Field Mapping Agent** (Second Pass with Additional Schema):\\n   - Re-run the mapping with the enriched schema snippet.\\n   - If still insufficient:  \\n     - At this point, to adhere to the new consideration, the Controller may decide to generate a partial SQL query with the available fields and run it.

By first producing text, the LLM can reason more naturally. A subsequent **Summary Agent** (if needed) could convert this textual reasoning into a structured JSON for downstream consumption.\\n\\n#### 3. Deciding Next Steps from Gap Detection\\n- If **gaps are detected**:\\n  - The Agent Workflow uses the gap analysis to generate an SQL query that fetches the missing pieces of information from the database.\\n  - Once the query is run and results are obtained, the workflow can be re-invoked with the additional data now available.\\n- If **no gaps are detected**:\\n  - Proceed directly to the **Field Matching** step.\\n\\nThis conditional branching ensures the workflow can iteratively refine its understanding.

Combining routing logic and table identification blurs these boundaries.  \\n   - *Risk*: Debugging and maintenance become more difficult. For example, if the system repeatedly routes incorrectly, is the cause the table-finding logic or the routing logic?

Gap Detection**\\n- **Inputs:**\\n  - Output from Table Finder Agent (related databases and tables)\\n  - User Query\\n- **Tasks:**\\n  - Assess if the identified tables and fields can fully address the user query.\\n  - Identify missing fields or data necessary to resolve ambiguities.\\n- **Outputs:**\\n  - If gaps exist:\\n    - List of required additional information or tables.\\n    - Potential queries to fetch missing data.\\n  - If no gaps:\\n    - Proceed to Field Matching.\\n\\n**Example Output (Gaps Detected):**\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"gaps\\\": [\\n    \\\"Need table providing AI company rankings\\\",\\n    \\\"Ambiguity in 'top' (e.g., based on revenue, market cap, etc.)\\\"\\n  ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### **3. Field Matching**\\n- **Inputs:**\\n  - User Query\\n  - Confirmed databases and tables from Table Finder Agent\\n  - Resolved gaps (if any)\\n- **Tasks:**\\n  - Map user query terms to specific fields within the identified tables.\\n  - Resolve ambiguities using available schema information.\\n- **Outputs:**\\n  - Mapped fields and their corresponding tables ready for SQL generation.\\n\\n**Example Output:**\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"mappings\\\": {\\n    \\\"full_name\\\": \\\"LC_StockArchives.ChiName\\\",\\n    \\\"company_code\\\": \\\"LC_StockArchives.CompanyCode\\\",\\n    \\\"AI_ranking\\\": \\\"AI_CompanyRankings.RankingPosition\\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### **4. SQL Generator**\\n- **Inputs:**\\n  - Mapped fields and corresponding tables from Field Matching\\n- **Tasks:**\\n  - Construct the SQL query based on the mappings.\\n  - Ensure the query accurately reflects the user's intent.\\n- **Outputs:**\\n  - Final SQL query ready for execution.\\n\\n**Example Output:**\\n```sql\\nSELECT LC_StockArchives.ChiName \\nFROM LC_StockArchives \\nJOIN AI_CompanyRankings ON LC_StockArchives.CompanyCode = AI_CompanyRankings.CompanyCode \\nWHERE AI_CompanyRankings.RankingPosition = 1;\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Critical Analysis and Professional Insights**\\n\\n#### **Strengths of the Current Workflow**\\n\\n1. **Modularity and Clarity:**\\n   - Each agent has a distinct responsibility, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle.\\n   - Clear separation ensures that each component can be developed, tested, and maintained independently.\\n\\n2. **Efficiency in Data Handling:**\\n   - By limiting the schema information passed to relevant agents, the system minimizes processing overhead and reduces costs associated with large context windows.\\n   - The Table Finder Agent's role as a router streamlines the decision-making process, eliminating the need for an additional routing agent.\\n\\n3. **Flexibility for Future Enhancements:**\\n   - The architecture accommodates future additions like a Reflection Mechanism without significant restructuring.\\n   - The modular design allows for iterative improvements and scalability.\\n\\n4. **Context Preservation in Multi-Turn Conversations:**\\n   - The workflow can handle multiple-turn interactions by maintaining context through SQL results and previous mappings.\\n   - By avoiding query rewriting, the system respects user input, maintaining the integrity of the original intent.\\n\\n#### **Potential Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement**\\n\\n1. **Overloading the Table Finder Agent:**\\n   - **Risk:** Combining routing logic with table identification may make the Table Finder Agent overly complex, potentially leading to inconsistent flagging (`database_dependency`).\\n   - **Mitigation:** Ensure robust prompt engineering and comprehensive few-shot examples to clearly delineate routing decisions from table identification tasks.\\n\\n2. **Gap Detection Complexity:**\\n   - **Risk:** Accurately identifying gaps requires deep understanding of both user intent and schema capabilities, which can be challenging for less capable LLMs.\\n   - **Mitigation:** Implement clear guidelines and structured prompts for Gap Detection. Consider limiting the scope of gap identification to prevent excessive complexity.\\n\\n3. **Error Propagation:**\\n   - **Risk:** Mistakes in early stages (e.g., incorrect table identification) can cascade, resulting in faulty SQL queries.\\n   - **Mitigation:** Introduce validation checks at each stage. For example, verify that identified tables contain expected fields before proceeding to the next step.\\n\\n4. **Handling Ambiguity in User Queries:**\\n   - **Risk:** Ambiguous terms may lead to incorrect field mappings or necessitate multiple iterations, increasing latency.\\n   - **Mitigation:** Encourage explicit user queries where possible. When ambiguity is detected, consider prompting the user for clarification before proceeding.\\n\\n5. **State Management in Multi-Turn Conversations:**\\n   - **Risk:** Maintaining accurate context across multiple turns is crucial. Loss or corruption of context can lead to misinterpretations.\\n   - **Mitigation:** Implement a robust state management system that securely stores and retrieves conversation history and SQL results, ensuring consistency and reliability.\\n\\n#### **Optimization Strategies**\\n\\n1. **Enhanced Prompt Engineering:**\\n   - **Table Finder Agent:**\\n     - Develop clear and concise prompt templates that differentiate between routing decisions and table identification.\\n     - Use explicit instructions and examples to guide the agent in setting the `database_dependency` flag accurately.\\n   \\n   - **Gap Detection:**\\n     - Structure prompts to focus on identifying specific missing elements rather than general gaps.\\n     - Provide examples of common gaps and appropriate responses to guide the agent’s reasoning.\\n\\n2. **Structured Data Passing:**\\n   - Utilize standardized JSON schemas for inter-agent communication to ensure consistency and reduce ambiguity.\\n   - Include necessary metadata (e.g., confidence scores, reason for flagging gaps) to aid downstream agents in decision-making.\\n\\n3. **Implementing Validation Layers:**\\n   - Introduce lightweight validation steps after critical agents to verify the accuracy and completeness of their outputs.\\n   - For instance, after Table Finder Agent identifies tables, a validation layer can check if the tables indeed contain the necessary fields before proceeding.\\n\\n4. **Contextual Awareness without Rewriting:**\\n   - Instead of rewriting queries, maintain a context object that maps ambiguous references (e.g., “this company”) to explicit identifiers based on prior interactions and SQL results.\\n   - Ensure that each agent has access to this context object to make informed decisions without altering user input.\\n\\n5. **Efficient State Management:**\\n   - Implement a centralized state repository (e.g., a context store) that records conversation history, previous SQL results, and resolved entities.\\n   - Ensure that agents can retrieve and update this context efficiently to maintain continuity across multi-turn conversations.\\n\\n6. **Fallback Mechanisms:**\\n   - When a critical agent fails or identifies an insurmountable gap, implement fallback procedures such as:\\n     - Prompting the user for additional information.\\n     - Providing partial results with explanations.\\n     - Suggesting alternative queries that can be answered with available data.\\n\\n7. **Performance Monitoring and Logging:**\\n   - Implement comprehensive logging to track agent decisions, outputs, and errors.\\n   - Use these logs to identify recurring issues, optimize agent prompts, and enhance overall system reliability.\\n\\n#### **Advanced Considerations for Robustness**\\n\\n1. **Dynamic Schema Updates:**\\n   - Enable the system to update its schema knowledge base dynamically as new tables or fields are introduced, ensuring that the Table Finder Agent always operates with the latest schema information.\\n   - Use versioning to track schema changes and manage compatibility with existing queries.\\n\\n2. **Adaptive Learning:**\\n   - Incorporate feedback loops where the system learns from successful and failed interactions to improve agent performance over time.\\n   - Use machine learning techniques to analyze patterns in user queries and agent responses, refining prompts and decision-making processes accordingly.\\n\\n3. **Scalable Architecture:**\\n   - Design the system to scale horizontally, allowing for multiple instances of agents to handle high query volumes without performance degradation.\\n   - Utilize containerization and orchestration tools (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) to manage agent deployments efficiently.\\n\\n4. **Security and Privacy:**\\n   - Ensure that all data passed between agents is securely handled, with appropriate encryption and access controls.\\n   - Implement data anonymization techniques where necessary to protect sensitive information.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Refined Example Scenario**\\n\\n**Initial Query:**\\n- **User:** \\\"What’s the full name of the company with code 1001?\\\"\\n- **Table Finder Agent Output:**\\n  ```json\\n  {\\n    \\\"related_databases\\\": [\\\"LC_StockArchives\\\"],\\n    \\\"related_tables\\\": [\\\"LC_StockArchives\\\"],\\n    \\\"database_dependency\\\": true\\n  }\\n  ```\\n- **Gap Detection Output:**\\n  ```json\\n  {\\n    \\\"gaps\\\": []\\n  }\\n  ```\\n- **Field Matching Output:**\\n  ```json\\n  {\\n    \\\"mappings\\\": {\\n      \\\"full_name\\\": \\\"LC_StockArchives.ChiName\\\",\\n      \\\"company_code\\\": \\\"LC_StockArchives.CompanyCode\\\"\\n    }\\n  }\\n  ```\\n- **SQL Generator Output:**\\n  ```sql\\n  SELECT ChiName FROM LC_StockArchives WHERE CompanyCode = '1001';\\n  ```\\n- **SQL Result:**\\n  ```json\\n  {\\n    \\\"ChiName\\\": \\\"Shenzhen Infotech Ltd.\\\"\\n  }\\n  ```\\n\\n**Subsequent Query:**\\n- **User:** \\\"What about its AI ranking?\\\"\\n- **Preprocessing Agent:**\\n  -
